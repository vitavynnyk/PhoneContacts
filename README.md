Hello! This is my project PhoneApplication.
I used Flyway migration for tables creation in Postgresql. My User can register in the app, login to the app, add new contact,
edit existing contact, delete existing contact, get list of existing contacts. When contact is added or edited, emails and
phone numbers are necessery validated.
Stack of technologies: Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data + Hibernate, REST.
I am going to add Spring Security.
